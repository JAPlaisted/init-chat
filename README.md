## Reflection

I learned a LOT during this project. This was my largest fullstack application to date. Backed by firebase, this application can handle sending thousands of messages a day. My main take away from this project was utilizing firebase with react, giving me the capability of creating scalable applications while focusing on UX/UI. Firebase also includes authentication services that I have integrated with this application to make it work with Gmail accounts. Lastly, this application features back-end code creating a banned users list. Before a message is sent, the program checks the banned users list, if the user is not listed, the message will send. 

This project is built with React and Firebase.
